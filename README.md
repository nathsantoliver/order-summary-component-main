Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned that in the construction of a layout, as simple as it may seem, concepts can be merged so that the construction is better understood by other people who read the code.

### Continued development

I need to delve into box model concepts, know the best time to use flexbox or grid. Training in these concepts is important for my skills in building a layout to be done in a more fluid and harmonious way.
### Useful resources

- [W3Schools CSS Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css) - This helped me to understand their concepts and application examples, making me understand if it is valid to apply that concept in the code or not.
- [CSS-Tricks Snippets](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/) - Like W3Schools, CSS trick helped me to understand concepts, mainly the applicability of flexbox and css grid, and the best way to style the page using these concepts.
